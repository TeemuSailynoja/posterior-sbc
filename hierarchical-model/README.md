# Case study: hierarchical model

Here are the source files for repeating the experiment of calibration assessment
for the simple hierarchical model presented in our paper.

The scripts for running the experiment are in [hm-prior-sbc.R](hm-prior-sbc.R) 
and [hm-posterior-sbc.R](hm-posterior-sbc.R), and the results are briefly 
discussed in [hierarchical-model-sbc.qmd](hierarchical-model-sbc.qmd), 
available in [pdf](hierarchical-model-sbc.pdf) and 
[html](hierarchical-model-sbc.html).

The Stan implementations for the models are available in the models folder.
